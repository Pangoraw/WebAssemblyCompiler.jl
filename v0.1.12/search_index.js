[{"location":"notes/#Notes","page":"Notes","title":"Notes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"notes/","page":"Notes","title":"Notes","text":"WebAssembly's Tuples and Structs cannot be indexed dynamically. Only fixed integer indexing works. So, Tuples are mapped as follows:\nNTuple -> WebAssembly's Fixed Array\nTuple -> WebAssembly's Tuple or Struct. The Struct will GC. WebAssembly's Tuple is more for handling multiple return values. The only option for dynamic indexing is some sort of table lookup.  \nThere is no equivalent of stack-allocated Tuples for StaticArrays. There are Fixed Arrays that are heap allocated. Maybe the browser can convert some of those to stack values. Bumper could substitute for stack allocation.\nYou can't get a pointer from GC heap-allocated arrays. You can't reinterpret or use pointer operations. You can have a buffer and pull in individual values and reinterpret those. That's slow, though.\nException handling doesn't work. The compiler doesn't currently handle PhiC nodes or Upsilon nodes in the SSA IR. Binaryen and WebAssembly support try, catch, and throw, so there's no technical reason this can't be supported.\nSimilarly error handling isn't attempted. Overlays are used to bypass error code to make things compile.\nThe compiler includes some known bandaids and rough spots.\nIn compile_block, the handling of QuoteNodes and Core.Const wrappers is uneven. Handling is included in a spotty fashion, but a more consistent approach would be better.\nOn the WebAssembly side, on-the-fly type detection doesn't work. Heap objects are not stored with type information. It would be possible to add type info to all types. Guile Hoot does this by adding a type hash to every struct.\nUnion's are not supported, and the path to supporting them is unclear. WebAssembly's type system doesn't have anything like that, and it also doesn't allow re-interpeting content easily.\nSeveral intrinsics are not supported. Some are challenging. do_apply / _apply_iterate look tough.\nSeveral of the existing intrinsics only support basic types (Int32, Int64, etc.). Better handling of these would be nice.\nString support is still limited. JavaScript is used to concatenate using string(...). JavaScript uses UTF16 for strings, and Julia's String uses UTF8. WebAssembly supports different string encodings and conversions. Right now, Strings are left as JavaScript strings. No character-level operations are supported. In the future, it may be best to match Julia's UTF8 format, but then strings would need to be converted when exchanged with JavaScript. Maybe different string options could be implemented.\nSymbols are currently converted straight to strings. That allows basic operations to work, including comparisons. This simple approach may cause issues for some code.\nBinaryen doesn't do any auto-vectorization. WebAssembly has basic SIMD types, but none are supported by WebAssemblyCompiler. \nLoopVectorization doesn't work. It's LLVM specific.\nUsing overlays with @jscall of normal Julia code will block constant propagation by the Julia compiler because the Julia compiler can't know what's happening and can't run it in the existing process.  \nWebAssembly doesn't support circular references, but Julia does. What we do is assign a default value for the circular reference and hope it doesn't cause problems. This works for the Observables support because the circular references aren't used after the set of Observables is statically compiled.\nThe support of aliased objects may still be patchy. Some were fixed up recently, but I worry that some still lurk (meaning you might get a copy when you want two references to point to the same object).","category":"page"},{"location":"notes/#Comparing-Approaches-to-Generating-WebAssembly","page":"Notes","title":"Comparing Approaches to Generating WebAssembly","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"notes/","page":"Notes","title":"Notes","text":"StaticCompiler can also generate WebAssembly from Julia code.
